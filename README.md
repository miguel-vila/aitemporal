- chunking:
  - steps:
    - condense audio lines by continuous speaker (we are loosing some start and end time accuracy here)
    - flatMap over condensed lines to split into smaller chunks (max 200 words) and by punctuation

  - if the heuristic fails, use embeddings: https://chatgpt.com/share/68cfcffd-ea90-8001-beb8-357c830c17ff
